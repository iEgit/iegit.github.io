# Setting Up a Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages

Creating a blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages is an excellent way to start sharing your thoughts and knowledge with the world. In this post, we'll walk through the essential steps.

## Why Jekyll + GitHub Pages?

The combination of Jekyll and GitHub Pages offers several advantages:

- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides free hosting for static sites
- **Version Control**: Your blog content is version-controlled with Git
- **Custom Domains**: Support for custom domain names
- **HTTPS**: Free SSL certificates included
- **No Database**: Static sites are faster and more secure

## Essential Files and Structure

A Jekyll blog requires several key files and directories:

### Configuration Files

- `_config.yml` - Main Jekyll configuration
- `Gemfile` - Ruby dependencies

### Directory Structure

```
├── _layouts/          # Page templates
├── _includes/         # Reusable components
├── _posts/           # Blog posts
├── _sass/            # SCSS stylesheets
├── assets/           # CSS, JavaScript, images
└── index.html        # Home page
```

## Writing Your First Post

Blog posts in Jekyll are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts/` directory. Each post should:

1. Follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Include YAML front matter with metadata
3. Use Markdown for content formatting

### Example Post Structure

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000

Your post content goes here...

- Customize the theme and styling

Happy blogging!
